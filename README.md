# create-python-lib

A standardized template for Urban Machine Python3.10+ projects.

## Why Use This Template?

This template helps streamline development by ensuring that every new Python project starts with the same setup, tools, and best practices. By using *cruft*, we link the project to the template, allowing us to apply template updates as our standards evolve, without disrupting existing codebases. It’s a fast, reliable way to maintain high-quality, secure, and consistent Python projects across the organization.

### Features

- **Python 3.10+ Compatibility**: Pre-configured environment for modern Python projects.
- **Automated Code Formatting**: Uses *black* and *isort* to keep code style consistent.
- **Comprehensive Linting**: *ruff* enforces style, security, and quality rules from multiple sources.
- **Static Type Checking**: *mypy* in strict mode to catch type errors early.
- **Testing and Code Coverage**: *pytest* and *pytest-cov* for testing with coverage tracking.
- **Security Scanning**: *bandit* checks for common security vulnerabilities.
- **Dependency Management**: *poetry* handles dependencies and virtual environments.
- **Template Sync with Cruft**: Stay up-to-date with template improvements across all projects.
- **CI/CD Ready**: GitHub Actions workflows for linting, testing, and optional Codecov integration.


## Quick Start Guide

### Adding the Template to an Existing Project

If you have an existing git repository and you want it to follow this template, 
use these instructions, start from **Step 1**. If you are starting a new project,
start from **Step 3**.

1. **Create a `template` branch:**
   ```shell
   git checkout --orphan template 
   ```
2. Clear files in this branch
   ```shell
   git reset --hard 
   ```
3. Install Cruft (if not already installed):

   This tool allows you to create projects from 'cookiecutter' repositories, such as this one. 
   ```shell
   pip install cruft
   ```
4. Initialize the template. This will create a new directory where the project files will
   be dumped.
   
   Fill in the form with the appropriate values for your project. The values in the 
   parameters are the default values that will be used if you don't fill in your own.
   ```shell
   cruft create https://github.com/UrbanMachine/create-python-lib.git
   ```
5. Add the generated files into the project directory and commit them to git.
6. Check that everything is synced with the template repository
   ```shell
   cruft check
   ```
7. Merge `template` into your `main` branch:

   You may need to use:
   ```shell
   git merge --allow-unrelated-histories template main
   ```
8. Delete the `template` branch
   
### Updating a Template on an Existing Project 
To pull in the latest template changes:
1.Run the following:
   ```shell
   cruft update --allow-untracked-files
   ```
2. Follow the prompts and resolve any merge conflicts that arise.

## Post Set-Up Guide
### Lock the pyproject.toml File
After adding the template to your project, you should lock the `pyproject.toml` file to ensure that all developers use the same dependencies. This file is generated by Poetry and should be committed to the repository. To lock the file, run:
```shell
poetry lock
```

Then commit the `pyproject.lock` file to the repository.

### Fixing the `lint` Github Action
This template automatically runs CI via github actions on every pull request. 

The CI uses cruft to check if there's been upstream changes on the template repository.
Depending on how you clone the repository, you might get the following error:

```shell
╭─ Error ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
│ Unable to initialize the cookiecutter using                                  │
│ git@github.com:UrbanMachine/create-ros-app.git! Failed to clone the repo.    │
│ stderr: 'Cloning into '/tmp/tmpavykj68r'...                                  │
│ git@github.com: Permission denied (publickey).                               │
│ fatal: Could not read from remote repository.                                │
│                                                                              │
│ Please make sure you have the correct access rights                          │
│ and the repository exists.                                                   │
│ '                                                                            │
╰──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
```

If you do, it's because github actions is trying to use SSH to clone the template repo, 
and failing. To fix this, edit your `.cruft.json` `template` key so it points to the
repository using `https://...your-url...git`

1. Generate an SSH Key
   ```shell
   ssh-keygen
   ```
2. Add the private key (`id_rsa`) to your Github repository's sectrets under the name `SSH_KEY`. Settings can be found under: 
   https://github.com/GITHUB_ORG/PROJECT_NAME/settings/secrets/actions

3. Add a public key (`id_rsa.pub`) to your repository's deploy keys on github. Settings can be found under: 
   https://github.com/GITHUB_ORG/PROJECT_NAME/settings/keys


### Optional: Adding Codecov Support
Codecov let's your project report on test coverage on every pull request. This process requires being an Admin on the github org this project lives in.

1. Sign in to [Codecov](https://about.codecov.io/sign-up/) with your Github account.
2. Under your repository in Codecov, select "Activate".
3. Get a codecov API token. Settings can be found under:
   https://app.codecov.io/gh/GITHUB_ORG/PROJECT_NAME/
4. Add a secret named `CODECOV_TOKEN` to your Github repositories secrets. Settings can be found under: 
   https://github.com/GITHUB_ORG/PROJECT_NAME/settings/secrets/actions
6. You should now be able to see code coverage under codecov!
